## üî¨ How the Simulation Works

### Monte Carlo Method
The simulation uses the Monte Carlo method, which:
1. **Runs thousands of race simulations** with random variations
2. **Models realistic race dynamics** including qualifying, overtakes, and DNFs
3. **Calculates probabilities** based on the frequency of outcomes
4. **Provides statistical confidence** through large sample sizes

### Race Simulation Process
1. **Qualifying Simulation**: Determines starting grid based on driver pace and consistency
2. **Race Simulation**: Simulates 50 laps with:
   - Overtaking based on pace differences and track characteristics
   - DNFs based on reliability ratings
   - Position changes throughout the race
3. **Result Analysis**: Calculates win, podium, and points probabilities

### Driver Rating System
Each driver is rated on multiple dimensions:
- **Base Speed**: Overall performance potential
- **Consistency**: How reliable their performance is
- **Qualifying Pace**: Single-lap performance
- **Race Pace**: Long-run performance
- **Reliability**: Mechanical reliability factor
- **Experience**: Years in F1 (affects certain tracks)
- **Current Form**: Recent performance multiplier

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Drivers
Edit the `_initialize_drivers()` method in `f1_simulation.py`:

```python
"New Driver": Driver("New Driver", "Team Name", 85, 0.85, 86, 85, 0.88, 3, 1.0)
```

### Adding New Tracks
Edit the `_initialize_tracks()` method:

```python
"New Track": {
    "type": "permanent_circuit",
    "overtaking_difficulty": 0.5,
    "technical_demand": 0.8,
    "weather_sensitivity": 0.7,
    "tire_wear": 0.6
}
```

### Adjusting Driver Ratings
Modify driver characteristics to reflect current form or new data:

```python
# Update Max Verstappen's current form
self.drivers["Max Verstappen"].current_form = 1.3  # 30% boost
```
